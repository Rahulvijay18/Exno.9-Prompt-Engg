## Aim: 
To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Video Generation

---
## **Completion Requirements:**

✔ Compare **simple vs. detailed prompts**
✔ Demonstrate **different prompting techniques** (style-based, camera direction, action-based, multi-prompt, story-prompting)
✔ Generate sample outputs (or screenshots/links if actual video generation is done)
✔ Record observations on changes in video quality and coherence

---

## **Theory:**

AI video generation models (e.g., Runway Gen-2, Pika Labs, Stable Video Diffusion, Sora, Kling AI) convert text prompts into short video clips.
The **clarity, detail, structure, and style** of the prompt significantly impact:

| Prompt Factor        | Impact on Video                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Detail level         | More detail = Better accuracy & object consistency                 |
| Style keywords       | Controls aesthetic/theme (e.g., “anime”, “realistic”, “cinematic”) |
| Camera directions    | Adds motion realism                                                |
| Time + Scene control | Improves storytelling quality                                      |

## **Prompt Types Used in This Experiment:**

| Prompt Technique            | Example Prompt                                                                                       | Goal                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Simple Prompt**           | “A cat walking”                                                                                      | Shows basic output quality     |
| **Detailed Prompt**         | “A fluffy white cat walking on a wooden floor in a cozy living room, natural lighting, 4K realistic” | Shows improvement with detail  |
| **Style-Based Prompt**      | “A cyberpunk animated cat walking in neon Tokyo streets, anime style”                                | Tests style influence          |
| **Camera Direction Prompt** | “A cat walking, camera tracking from behind, smooth cinematic movement”                              | Tests camera motion            |
| **Story-Based Prompt**      | “Scene 1: Cat wakes up. Scene 2: Cat walks to window. Scene 3: Cat watches rain outside.”            | Tests multi-scene storytelling |

## **Procedure:**

1. Select one AI video generation tool (Runway, Pika Labs, Sora, or any available model).
2. Choose a common concept for comparison — e.g., “A cat walking”.
3. Generate five videos using the five prompting techniques listed above.
4. Record observations for each generated video:

   * Visual quality
   * Motion smoothness
   * Object consistency
   * Style accuracy
   * Coherence with the prompt
5. Compare results and analyze how prompt structure affected the output.

## **Observations Table:** *(Sample Format)*

| Prompt Type             | Video Quality | Coherence | Style Accuracy   | Notes                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Simple Prompt           | ★★☆☆☆         | Low       | Basic            | Lacks detail and realism  |
| Detailed Prompt         | ★★★★☆         | High      | Realistic        | More accurate to prompt   |
| Style-Based Prompt      | ★★★★☆         | Medium    | Excellent        | Strong creativity & theme |
| Camera Direction Prompt | ★★★★☆         | High      | Cinematic        | Smooth motion             |
| Story-Based Prompt      | ★★★★★         | Very High | Varies per scene | Best for narrative videos |

## **Conclusion:**

Prompt structure directly influences the effectiveness of AI video generation.

* Simple prompts produce basic and less accurate results.
* Detailed prompts improve clarity, realism, and object consistency.
* Adding style, camera directions, and scene sequencing enhances visual storytelling and creativity.

Therefore, to generate high-quality AI videos, prompts should be detailed, structured, and include style, action, and camera movement instructions.
